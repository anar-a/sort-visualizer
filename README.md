# sort-visualizer

A sort visualizer made with QT C++. A few sort algorithms are implemented, including bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort.
This visualizer mostly utilizes the QPainter widget, in combination with QVectors to hold and sort the data.

A quick demo of the bubble sort and other features such as changing the delay between each redraw pause, cancelling, and resetting:
